# Introduction:

  Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a collection of remote computing services,
  also called web services, that make up a cloud-computing platform offered by Amazon.com.
  It is one of the amazing and most popular cloud services used by multiple companies around the globe.
  
# Starting Point:

1. Start by creating an AWS account.
2. Build up an EC2 image instance of your choice.
  (I had choosen t2.micro image for my reference) 
3. After creating your instance, use
ssh -i "secret.pem" ubuntu@45.67.23.14
to login into your instance. 

PS:
If you have any problem regarding logging into your instance,
try rebooting your instance from aws console.
